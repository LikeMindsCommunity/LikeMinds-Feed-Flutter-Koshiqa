This repository holds the Feed UI for LikeMinds Feed service.

## Getting started

Follow the documentation to create LikeMinds account and get access to your API key. This is a prerequisite.

After cloning the repository, the sample app lives in the example folder. Run the main function to start the sample app.

```dart
main();
```

The sample app already has a test community loaded in the credentials file. To start using your own credentials edit the `credentials.dart` file.

The sample UI package has componenets which you can use in your own code by using this package locally by providing a path to the root directory in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

The LikeMinds Feed SDK package is hosted on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/likeminds_feed)
